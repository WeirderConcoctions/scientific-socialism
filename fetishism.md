## Commodity Fetishism
1. Commodity fetishism is the practice of being assured of value on an object's direct front, rather than seeing what constitutes its value. 
    1. For example, when buying a table, one only observes its direct face- and assumes that the chair is constant. However, the fact that the chair is actually a convergence or culmination of cultures and labour, its purpose and philosophy are all ignored.
    2. The object's value emanates from the object itself, rather than from the labour and thought going into it. 
2. However, this example is not perfect. Commodity fetishism applies to humans and business more than it does to a physical, non-living object such as a chair or a table.
    1.  According to Marx, labour is social work. Labourers have a personal and economic relation with their produce, and also have a personal connection with those with whom they make a product collectively.
    2. However, when the produce comes into the eyes of a consumer, the object is devoid of humanness. The object becomes a mere object for sale rather than a culmination of social and cultural convergence.
    3. In one way, commodity fetishism is a criticism of how the credit for the production of an object goes to a capitalist brand/figure rather than the multitude of people who actually produced the object.
3. Commodity fetishism also applies to how a labourer,  under a capitalist system where he or she is presumably oppressed, is treated as yet another object. The value of the person's skill and labour is replaced by their market value. 
4. Commodity fetishism is an important aspect of how capitalists sustain.
    1. Often, the process of production is extremely abusive and exploitative to workers. However, commodity fetishism allows the consumer to ignore the suffering that shaped the product.
    2. It is crucial to capitalists that consumers know nothing of the slave-labour behind the production of a good. Most consumers would be repulsed by the idea of buying an object created by exploitation if they knew of it.
    3. Therefore, commodity fetishism helps capitalists ensure the consumer forgets the exploitation, and thus increases their profits.
