<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="alienation"><a class="header" href="#alienation">Alienation</a></h1>
<p>Alienation is the sense of detachment from life, becoming only a cog in the wheels of the capitalist machinery. There are 4 types of alienation. </p>
<h3 id="alienation-of-product-from-labour"><a class="header" href="#alienation-of-product-from-labour">Alienation of Product from Labour</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>When a worker creates a product, their capitalist overlord detaches them from  their product and sells them to a customer.</li>
<li>The value of labour is much cheaper than the value of the product they create.</li>
<li>Thus, the worker can never afford their own product, and thus is completely alienated from his/her product of labour.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="alienation-from-act-of-production"><a class="header" href="#alienation-from-act-of-production">Alienation from Act of Production</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Workers do not always work from their will, and do not enjoy the act of production. </li>
<li>Most often, workers engage in the act of production to gain a wage to sustain themselves in the capitalist society, and afford basic necessities. </li>
<li>Their labour is a commodity which they sell by force rather than of their own accord. Their labour and their produce belong to the capitalist, rather than to them.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="alienation-from-species-essence"><a class="header" href="#alienation-from-species-essence">Alienation from 'Species-Essence'</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>According to Marx, an animal only produces in direct, physical need.</li>
<li>However, humans labour to produce something even when free of physical need. This, according to Marx, was the 'species-essence' which separated human from animal.</li>
<li>As demonstrated by the earlier types of alienation, most workers offer labour to capitalists only to produce items, mostly without their own will. They produce for the capitalist in order to survive.</li>
<li>By this, the 'human-essence' is lost in a worker, as they only produce to meet their direct, physical needs, or basic necessities of life- food, water, shelter, and clothing.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="alienation-from-man-from-man"><a class="header" href="#alienation-from-man-from-man">Alienation from Man from Man</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Alienation from man to man is practically the same as Commodity Fetishism.</li>
<li>The consumer and the worker have no relations, as the produce of the labour is commodified and the social relations behind its creation made cryptic to the consumer.</li>
<li>Thus, the worker is completely alienated from the consumer of his produce, and thus alienated from other human beings. </li>
<li>Alienation from man to man is related to reification. Reification, a Marxist concept by George Lucas is the over-simplification of abstract concepts without concrete definitions like music, art, politics, economy, and social sciences- any concept which has a great web of social relations behind its production, but not necessarily built of exploitation. Commodity Fetishism is a type of reification.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="commodity-fetishism"><a class="header" href="#commodity-fetishism">Commodity Fetishism</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Commodity fetishism is the practice of being assured of value on an object's direct front, rather than seeing what constitutes its value. 
<ol>
<li>For example, when buying a table, one only observes its direct face- and assumes that the chair is constant. However, the fact that the chair is actually a convergence or culmination of cultures and labour, its purpose and philosophy are all ignored.</li>
<li>The object's value emanates from the object itself, rather than from the labour and thought going into it. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>However, this example is not perfect. Commodity fetishism applies to humans and business more than it does to a physical, non-living object such as a chair or a table.
<ol>
<li>According to Marx, labour is social work. Labourers have a personal and economic relation with their produce, and also have a personal connection with those with whom they make a product collectively.</li>
<li>However, when the produce comes into the eyes of a consumer, the object is devoid of humanness. The object becomes a mere object for sale rather than a culmination of social and cultural convergence.</li>
<li>In one way, commodity fetishism is a criticism of how the credit for the production of an object goes to a capitalist brand/figure rather than the multitude of people who actually produced the object.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Commodity fetishism also applies to how a labourer,  under a capitalist system where he or she is presumably oppressed, is treated as yet another object. The value of the person's skill and labour is replaced by their market value. </li>
<li>Commodity fetishism is an important aspect of how capitalists sustain.
<ol>
<li>Often, the process of production is extremely abusive and exploitative to workers. However, commodity fetishism allows the consumer to ignore the suffering that shaped the product.</li>
<li>It is crucial to capitalists that consumers know nothing of the slave-labour behind the production of a good. Most consumers would be repulsed by the idea of buying an object created by exploitation if they knew of it.</li>
<li>Therefore, commodity fetishism helps capitalists ensure the consumer forgets the exploitation, and thus increases their profits.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="terminology"><a class="header" href="#terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
<h3 id="dialectics"><a class="header" href="#dialectics">Dialectics</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Dialectics refers to discussion and debate which leads to the formation of a synthesis.</li>
<li>Dialectics is the method of reasoning which aims to understand things concretely in all their development, movement and interconnection, with their opposite and contradictory sides in unity.</li>
<li>Procedure: A thesis is proposed. An antithesis argues it. As flaws in both arguments are clear, a common idea is formed, called the synthesis. Each synthesis is a thesis, too, and may have another antithesis. 
<ol>
<li>This is often credited to Hegel, and is thus called Hegelian Dialectics.</li>
<li>However, this is not the entirety of dialectics, and is only an oversimplified version of events. </li>
<li>Often, a synthesis cannot be reached because despite materialism stating that a synthesis always does exist, the human mind has not given it thought, ie, cannot think of it subjectively.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Dialectics continue until a final, unchanged synthesis is reached. But it is very unlikely that any synthesis can reach such a state, for human nature and ego prevents it.</li>
<li>A thesis and antithesis are always in both unity and contradiction of each other. Read Engel's Laws of Dialectics below for an example.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="idealistic-materialism"><a class="header" href="#idealistic-materialism">Idealistic Materialism:</a></h3>
<p>Materialism is human perception of reality, matter, and thought.</p>
<ol>
<li>As stated earlier, since a thesis and antithesis are always in a unity of opposition, the distinguishing mark between idealistic materialism and philosophical materialism emerges. 
<ol>
<li>
<p>Idealistic materialism refers to simple, conversation ideas, in which forming a synthesis is faster and easier. Every possible kind of matter and thought exists. Everything exists regardless of human perception. They have existed, will exist, and will continue to exist, even if we cannot perceive them subjectively. This concept was developed by Hegels, but not discovered/invented by him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Philosophical materialism refers to the realm of political economies, class contradictions, and political ideas, in which human ego and selfishness play a much bigger role, for they restrict the creation of a synthesis for their own needs. Everything stems from the mind, and potentially, all that exists is a single mind, with everything outside of it being a mere illusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marx explains &quot;It is not the consciousness of a human that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Modern science relies on Materialism for the start of all its research, for it allows for either:
<ol>
<li>The mind of a scientist to perceive a concept before discovering it.</li>
<li>The scientist looking for what has not been discovered, before perceiving it. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="dialectal-materialism"><a class="header" href="#dialectal-materialism">Dialectal Materialism</a></h1>
<ol>
<li>Marxists view all reality as interconnected and constantly changing.</li>
<li>Darwin's Theory on the Evolution of Organisms illustrates such interconnected and constantly changing reality.</li>
<li>It is only through the study of dialectics that the mind will stop being bound by the restrictions of metaphysical rigidity, and understand the perpetual, fluid motion of reality.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Dialectics in the proper sense is the study of the contradiction in the very essence of objects [reality]
~ Vladmir Lenin</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Engels layed out three essential rules to Dialectics:</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-unity-and-struggle-of-opposites"><a class="header" href="#the-unity-and-struggle-of-opposites"><strong>The Unity and Struggle of Opposites:</strong></a></h2>
<p>The Unity of Opposites exists in all objects from beginning to end, if such a time be. </p>
<ol>
<li><em>Example: there could be no exploiter without the exploited. Though both having opposing ideas, and thus become a thesis and antithesis, one could not exist without the other, which means that they can only exist in unity- a unity of opposites.</em></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The splitting of a single whole and cognition of its contradictory parts is the essence of dialectics. This aspect of dialectics usually receives inadequate attention: the identity of opposites is taken as the sum-total of examples and not as a law of cognition.&quot;
~ Vladmir Lenin
&quot;The unity (coincidence, identity, equal action) of opposites is conditional, temporary, transitory, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, just as development and motion are absolute.&quot;
~ Vladmir Lenin</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>The constant struggle between the opposites, caused by their unity, pushes them into eternal motion. </li>
<li>It is also called the Law of Contradiction.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-transformation-from-quantity-into-quality-quantitative-changes-always-lead-to-qualitative-changes"><a class="header" href="#the-transformation-from-quantity-into-quality-quantitative-changes-always-lead-to-qualitative-changes">The Transformation from Quantity into Quality:** Quantitative changes always lead to Qualitative changes.</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Quantitative change is considered to be gradual change.</li>
<li>Qualitative change is considered to be revolutionary change.</li>
<li>After a certain level of gradual change through increase or decrease, a qualitative leap occurs which fundamentally changes the way</li>
<li>For example, after gradual heating of water, at a certain temperature, it will evaporate. The temperature change is a quantitative change, while the evaporation is qualitative change.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-negation-of-the-negation-this-law-states-that-every-old-thing-is-superceded-by-a-new-thing"><a class="header" href="#the-negation-of-the-negation-this-law-states-that-every-old-thing-is-superceded-by-a-new-thing">The Negation of the Negation:** This law states that every old thing is superceded by a new thing.</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>For example, in the previous example. When the water starts to heat up, the cold water becomes hot water. This is a negation. The evaporation of the water is a second negation. Some time after, the vapour will condense, and yet another negation occurs.</li>
<li>Thus, it can be said that every negation gets negated, by a newer negation. The cycle runs eternally and thus the universe moves.</li>
<li>Negation in Marxism does not represent complete wiping out of the previous one. For example, when feudalism became prominent, slavery continued to be, and when capitalism became dominated, remanants of feudalism still remained.</li>
<li>In short, Dialectal Materialism is the understanding of reality, in the form of thoughts, emotions, or material objects, in their continuous gradual change, due to contradictions within a process, which is pushed forward by the unity of opposites within that process, leading to the negation of the old negation, causing a revolutionary, qualitative change.</li>
<li>It is proof that history is not moved by visionary men and their ideals, but instead, the struggle between people and reality.
<blockquote>
<p>“History is not like some individual person, which uses men to achieve its ends. History is nothing but the actions of men in pursuit of their ends.”
~ Karl Marx</p>
</blockquote>

</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="the-unity-of-opposites"><a class="header" href="#the-unity-of-opposites">The Unity of Opposites</a></h2>
<p>The Unity of Opposites is related to, but not the same as the Law of Contradiction.</p>
<ol>
<li>The metaphysical and evolutionist world sees all reality completely isolated from context, and thus perceives it to be static and one-dimensional.</li>
<li>However, every segment of reality in the universe has its own internal contradictions, which are the primary cause behind its motion and development. External contradictions, or interaction and relations with other things, are secondary factors of its development.</li>
<li>Mao explains that the Unity of Opposites is the fundamental, governing law in all development, and stands opposed to the metaphysical world outlook.</li>
<li>Contradictions may have similar universal aspects, but are never the same. For example, the Russian and Chinese revolution were both struggles to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, but played out very differently due to different circumstances.</li>
<li>According to Mao, contradictions are resolved in different matters. Antagonistic contradictions are resolved through revolution, as is between the proletariat and bourgeoise. Differences between the workers and peasants will be resolved through collectivisation, while differences within the Communist Party are resolved through criticism and self-criticism.</li>
<li>There are an infinite number of contradictions at any given situation. However, the contradiction whose existence and development influences that of other contradictions is the principal contradiction. Only one principal contradiction exists in a situation, but it always exists, until the situation itself ceases to be. Even such, another contradiction is formed. 
<ol>
<li>For example, in a capitalist society, the conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoise forms the principal contradiction. Secondary contradictions include conflict between the bourgeoise and the petty-bourgeoise.</li>
<li>In every contradiction, one aspect is stronger than the other. The stronger aspect, in a capitalist society, is the bourgeoise, due to their power, wealth, and influence over bourgeoise state apparatus including the police and military.</li>
<li>The struggle of the non-principal aspect against the principal aspect drives change.  An antagonistic contradiction has to be resolved through force, while other contradictions can be resolved through peaceful methods. </li>
<li>Through this change, the principal and non-principal aspect switch sides. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Mao, in 'On Contradiction', states that the Unity of Opposites is temporary, for it is a standstill, a stalemate, a harmony between the two opposing forces. For example, in a capitalist country, the Unity of Opposites could only exist if there is only weak or negligible  revolution and counter-revolution.</li>
<li>The moment quantitative changes within the struggle create a qualitative change, the unity of opposites is destroyed. Thus, the struggle is permanent and absolute, while the Unity of Opposites is temporary and conditional.</li>

<li>A party of rigorous discipline and iron will to create the revolution must be established. 
<ol>
<li>The bourgeoise are accompanied by their state apparatus of oppression- the police,  military,  etc.</li>
<li>Once they sense a proletarian revolutionary disturbance, their resistance to the revolution and their oppression to the proletarians, unions, and communists increases greatly.</li>
<li>Lenin, by 'iron will and discipline' is referring to unmoved devotion to the cause of the establishment of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.</li>
<li>He explains that party members should not get intimidated by the bourgeoise's might- and instead be determined to bring it down.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The masses must have seen from their own experience that the party's strategies and political tactics work properly; the people must bear witness to the party's ability to adapt and improvise.</li>
<li>The party's members must merge and freely interact with the masses wherever possible- including bourgeoise and reactionary forums like the institutions under the bourgeoise's control- the parliament and media.
<ol>
<li>The party members must agitate for socialism in these meetings and gatherings.</li>
<li>They must also bring popular support to the downfall of these bourgeoise institutions, and expose their authoritarian control over people.</li>
<li>The party should educate people on their rights.</li>
<li>It must operate both local circles and mass-movements.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The party members must have a firm foundation in and a flawless understanding of Marxist Theory.
<ol>
<li>They must apply this theory to their situation- using Dialectical and Historical Materialism to analyse the present contradictions, conflict, unity, and methods to resolve these contradictions.</li>
<li>They must thoroughly study the history of their present situation.</li>
<li>The party's member's should be thoroughly class-conscious and should work to educate the proletarian masses on the same.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The party's operations must be flexible.
<ol>
<li>It should have the capacity to make and break promises and contracts, to rethink decisions.</li>
<li>It should have the freedom and capability to operate in whichever method may suit it at the time- so long as it does not deter from the goal of establishing the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, underground or open, parliamentary or rebellious, legal and illegal.</li>

<p>Note that even where the word 'communism' is used, it is not referring to a true communist state, but a socialist state. Communism is a stateless society, a form of society which has never been achieved in human history, except for in the form of primitive communism. </p>
<h2 id="communism-has-caused-100-million-deaths"><a class="header" href="#communism-has-caused-100-million-deaths">Communism has caused 100 million deaths</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Colonialism, though started by feudal lords, continued under capitalism and thus is also capitalist endeavour. Capitalists, in their desire to acquire more power and profit, exploit the resources and people of a country. Colonisation only picked up steam, and in that sense, it marks the birth of capitalism.
<ol>
<li>Feudalism, as mentioned in the Communist Manifesto, does not require the resources of other countries to sustain, despite still being unequal and exploitative to its own people, like capitalism. </li>
<li>On the other hand, the Manifesto states that capitalism grows into imperialism via the 'freer' trade it offers, and the external profits. In such, the colonisation of India was an inherently capitalist endeavour, in fact, capitalist to such an extent that it is pure imperialism.</li>
<li>The Colonisation of India alone caused 35+ million deaths. Hence, why not use the same metrics to define 'failure' for a communist and a capitalist country? </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Under Hitler, Germany was excessively privatised.
<ol>
<li>It was only because of this was the word 'Privatisation' created, used to describe Hitler's excessive measures to boost the economy.</li>
<li>Nazi Germany killed approximately 11 million Jews, with several million more Gypsies and Disabled, with more uncounted. This brings their death toll to approximately 20 million.
<ol>
<li>Often, it is said that Communist Countries were worse than the Nazis. </li>
<li>However, it must be taken into account that Germany was a small nation with a small population, when compared to Russia, a huge country, or China, the most populated country.</li>
<li>If deaths are counted in percentages, a privatised, fascist state would kill much more than the communists in both Russia and China, provided that they also are in power for as long as Stalin or Zedong.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>&quot;One death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic&quot; - Iosof Stalin
The fact that capitalists use these deaths to oppose communism, not taking note of their own crimes, shows that to them, deaths are no more than tools to oppose what they dislike.</li>
<li>When scholars examined archival evidence released by the Soviet Union, it was revealed that Stalin's death toll was much lower than it was made out to be capitalists claimed it to be. 
<ol>
<li>The toll of '50 million deaths under Stalin' was largely an estimate based on guesses, rumours and isolated observations.</li>
<li>The actual death count for USSR under Stalin was actually a much smaller 20 million. Even with an under-reporting rate of 10%, it is not possible or Stalin to have killed 50 million people in his tenure.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Every country is a dictatorship in one way or the other. While capitalist nations oppress their poor population, often upto 90% of the total population, under socialist states, the richest are oppressed to empower the poor.
<ol>
<li>For example, if India were socialist, Ambani and Adani's rights would be stripped in order to empower a billion other workers. </li>
<li>The reason the poor cannot be free without the lack of freedom amongst the rich is because these rich capitalists, if not restricted, will create counter revolution using their power and wealth, in order to reclaim their properties.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>It is also important to note that many Capitalist Countries have been dictatorships too- Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and the Colonialists of Europe.
<ol>
<li>The Colonialists of Europe, as mentioned, were imperialists and plundered and massacred the 'barbarious' cultures, seeking to model the world to their own perception of perfection.</li>
<li>Leopold II is a perfect example of the sheer cruelty of Imperialists. Congo was his private property, and he abused and exploited its people to no extent. Under his rule, more than 10 million people died. His men raped and kidnapped young women and children for entertainment, and men were overworked in factories and fields. The punishment for not finishing work was to see your own, or your child's hands cut off.</li>
<li>Nazi Germany, as mentioned above already, has a death toll of over 20 million. </li>
<li>Mussolini's soldiers committed over 1,200 gruesome war crimes, including collective punishment, but none were prosecuted for it.</li>
<li>USA, Canada, and Australia have already borne the brunt of capitalist voyages. As the colonialists discovered these continents, their native populations were very often the subject of the most extreme atrocities- rape, torture, and massacre.</li>

<p>After the October Revolution in Russia, there was a spurt in freedom of 'otherly' arts and culture.</p>
<ol>
<li>Painters took on new styles, and music expanded to forms unknown to the rest of the world- atonal, usage of polyrhythms and additive rhythms, etc.</li>
<li>Abstract art flourished and was praised for being 'revolutionary', defying all the existing norms of capitalist/feudal culture.</li>
<li>Despite the reign of Stalin declaring an 'official style' of music and art, it was more due to Stalin's personal weaknesses rather than the fault of socialism as a whole.</li>
<li>George Lucas, an infamous MLM film-director from the USA, said in response to a question in an interview, asking if he felt lucky that he lived in 'free' USA rather than 'suppressed' USSR, that he realised that his friends in the USSR have more artistic freedom than him. He said that in the USSR, artists could produce whatever they wished, as long as they did not criticise the government excessively. However, he said, in the USA, he couldn't criticise the government, and had to restrict himself to a very narrow line of commercialism.</li>

<ol>
<li>Communism has caused a lesser number of deaths through famine in almost 130 years in huge, populated countries, than the capitalist nations of Africa do in 10 years. Africa is full of capitalism and corruption, leading to 10 million deaths by starvation or dehydration per year. </li>
<li>The much criticised-bread lines of the USSR exist under capitalism too, in the form of crowded grocery stores and markets, with the only difference being that under capitalism, one has to pay for food in these shops, while people in the bread lines would be given food for free.</li>
<li>A CIA report even acknowledged that the quantity of food consumed by an average US and USSR citizen daily was roughly the same, with the diffences being:
<ol>
<li>There was more equality in the quantity of food consumed by citizens of USSR, irrespective of power, than in the USA, where the rich and powerful consumed more food daily than the poor.</li>
<li>The average Soviet diet was more nutritious across social classes. (Note: Social classes were not completely eliminated in the USSR. However, the gap between each social class decreased).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>After the famines in USSR and China, helpful measures were implemented and they did not have as big a problem as before.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Communist countries are completely rebuilt from dire poverty. For example, both Russia and China were being ravaged by imperialist rulers and the bourgeoise, with the majority of the population, working class, being poor.</li>
<li>However, communist countries were able to empower their working class extremely quickly, despite being very often being interrupted or attacked by imperialist powers from abroad, like the USA.</li>
<li>USSR was the first to send a satellite and a man into space, which is proof that they were able to boost their economies.</li>
<li>Both USSR and China were global superpowers within 50 years of the revolution, despite starting off so poor. Both the nations were rebuilt completely from the base.</li>
