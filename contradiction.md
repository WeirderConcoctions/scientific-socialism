## The Unity of Opposites
The Unity of Opposites is related to, but not the same as the Law of Contradiction.

1. The metaphysical and evolutionist world sees all reality completely isolated from context, and thus perceives it to be static and one-dimensional.
2. However, every segment of reality in the universe has its own internal contradictions, which are the primary cause behind its motion and development. External contradictions, or interaction and relations with other things, are secondary factors of its development.
3. Mao explains that the Unity of Opposites is the fundamental, governing law in all development, and stands opposed to the metaphysical world outlook.
4. Contradictions may have similar universal aspects, but are never the same. For example, the Russian and Chinese revolution were both struggles to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, but played out very differently due to different circumstances.
5. According to Mao, contradictions are resolved in different matters. Antagonistic contradictions are resolved through revolution, as is between the proletariat and bourgeoise. Differences between the workers and peasants will be resolved through collectivisation, while differences within the Communist Party are resolved through criticism and self-criticism.
6. There are an infinite number of contradictions at any given situation. However, the contradiction whose existence and development influences that of other contradictions is the principal contradiction. Only one principal contradiction exists in a situation, but it always exists, until the situation itself ceases to be. Even such, another contradiction is formed. 
    1. For example, in a capitalist society, the conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoise forms the principal contradiction. Secondary contradictions include conflict between the bourgeoise and the petty-bourgeoise.
    2. In every contradiction, one aspect is stronger than the other. The stronger aspect, in a capitalist society, is the bourgeoise, due to their power, wealth, and influence over bourgeoise state apparatus including the police and military.
    3. The struggle of the non-principal aspect against the principal aspect drives change.  An antagonistic contradiction has to be resolved through force, while other contradictions can be resolved through peaceful methods. 
    4. Through this change, the principal and non-principal aspect switch sides. 
7. Mao, in 'On Contradiction', states that the Unity of Opposites is temporary, for it is a standstill, a stalemate, a harmony between the two opposing forces. For example, in a capitalist country, the Unity of Opposites could only exist if there is only weak or negligible  revolution and counter-revolution.
8. The moment quantitative changes within the struggle create a qualitative change, the unity of opposites is destroyed. Thus, the struggle is permanent and absolute, while the Unity of Opposites is temporary and conditional.
