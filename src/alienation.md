# Alienation

Alienation is the sense of detachment from life, becoming only a cog in the wheels of the capitalist machinery. There are 4 types of alienation. 

### Alienation of Product from Labour

1. When a worker creates a product, their capitalist overlord detaches them from  their product and sells them to a customer.
2. The value of labour is much cheaper than the value of the product they create.
3. Thus, the worker can never afford their own product, and thus is completely alienated from his/her product of labour.

### Alienation from Act of Production

1. Workers do not always work from their will, and do not enjoy the act of production. 
2. Most often, workers engage in the act of production to gain a wage to sustain themselves in the capitalist society, and afford basic necessities. 
3. Their labour is a commodity which they sell by force rather than of their own accord. Their labour and their produce belong to the capitalist, rather than to them.

### Alienation from 'Species-Essence'

1. According to Marx, an animal only produces in direct, physical need.
2. However, humans labour to produce something even when free of physical need. This, according to Marx, was the 'species-essence' which separated human from animal.
3. As demonstrated by the earlier types of alienation, most workers offer labour to capitalists only to produce items, mostly without their own will. They produce for the capitalist in order to survive.
4. By this, the 'human-essence' is lost in a worker, as they only produce to meet their direct, physical needs, or basic necessities of life- food, water, shelter, and clothing.

### Alienation from Man from Man

1. Alienation from man to man is practically the same as Commodity Fetishism.
2. The consumer and the worker have no relations, as the produce of the labour is commodified and the social relations behind its creation made cryptic to the consumer.
3. Thus, the worker is completely alienated from the consumer of his produce, and thus alienated from other human beings. 
4. Alienation from man to man is related to reification. Reification, a Marxist concept by George Lucas is the over-simplification of abstract concepts without concrete definitions like music, art, politics, economy, and social sciences- any concept which has a great web of social relations behind its production, but not necessarily built of exploitation. Commodity Fetishism is a type of reification.
