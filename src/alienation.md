# Alienation

Alienation is the sense of detachment from life, becoming only a cog in the wheels of the capitalist machinery. There are 4 types of alienation. 

### Alienation of Product from Labour

1. When a worker creates a product, their capitalist overlord detaches them from  their product and sells them to a customer.
2. The value of labour is much cheaper than the value of the product they create.
3. Thus, the worker can never afford their own product, and thus is completely alienated from his/her product of labour.

### Alienation from Act of Production

1. Workers do not always work from their will, and do not enjoy the act of production. 
2. Most often, workers engage in the act of production to gain a wage to sustain themselves in the capitalist society, and afford basic necessities. 
3. Their labour is a commodity which they sell by force rather than of their own accord. Their labour and their produce belong to the capitalist, rather than to them.

### Alienation from 'Species-Essence'

1. According to Marx, an animal only produces in direct, physical need.
2. However, humans labour to produce something even when free of physical need. This, according to Marx, was the 'species-essence' which separated human from animal.
3. As demonstrated by the earlier types of alienation, most workers offer labour to capitalists only to produce items, mostly without their own will. They produce for the capitalist in order to survive.
4. By this, the 'human-essence' is lost in a worker, as they only produce to meet their direct, physical needs, or basic necessities of life- food, water, shelter, and clothing.

### Alienation from Man from Man

1. Alienation from man to man is practically the same as Commodity Fetishism.
2. The consumer and the worker have no relations, as the produce of the labour is commodified and the social relations behind its creation made cryptic to the consumer.
3. Thus, the worker is completely alienated from the consumer of his produce, and thus alienated from other human beings. 
4. Alienation from man to man is related to reification. Reification, a Marxist concept by George Lucas is the over-simplification of abstract concepts without concrete definitions like music, art, politics, economy, and social sciences- any concept which has a great web of social relations behind its production, but not necessarily built of exploitation. Commodity Fetishism is a type of reification.
5. Commodity fetishism is the practice of being assured of value on an object's direct front, rather than seeing what constitutes its value. 
    1. For example, when buying a table, one only observes its direct face- and assumes that the chair is constant. However, the fact that the chair is actually a convergence or culmination of cultures and labour, its purpose and philosophy are all ignored.
    2. The object's value emanates from the object itself, rather than from the labour and thought going into it. 
6. However, this example is not perfect. Commodity fetishism applies to humans and business more than it does to a physical, non-living object such as a chair or a table.
    1.  According to Marx, labour is social work. Labourers have a personal and economic relation with their produce, and also have a personal connection with those with whom they make a product collectively.
    2. However, when the produce comes into the eyes of a consumer, the object is devoid of humanness. The object becomes a mere object for sale rather than a culmination of social and cultural convergence.
    3. In one way, commodity fetishism is a criticism of how the credit for the production of an object goes to a capitalist brand/figure rather than the multitude of people who actually produced the object.
7. Commodity fetishism also applies to how a labourer,  under a capitalist system where he or she is presumably oppressed, is treated as yet another object. The value of the person's skill and labour is replaced by their market value. 
8. Commodity fetishism is an important aspect of how capitalists sustain.
    1. Often, the process of production is extremely abusive and exploitative to workers. However, commodity fetishism allows the consumer to ignore the suffering that shaped the product.
    2. It is crucial to capitalists that consumers know nothing of the slave-labour behind the production of a good. Most consumers would be repulsed by the idea of buying an object created by exploitation if they knew of it.
    3. Therefore, commodity fetishism helps capitalists ensure the consumer forgets the exploitation, and thus increases their profits.
