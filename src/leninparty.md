# How to build a Revolutionary Party- Lenin
### *From Chapter 2 'An Essential Condition to the Bolshevik's success' in 'Left Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder'*
1. A party of rigorous discipline and iron will to create the revolution must be established. 
    1. The bourgeoise are accompanied by their state apparatus of oppression- the police,  military,  etc.
    2. Once they sense a proletarian revolutionary disturbance, their resistance to the revolution and their oppression to the proletarians, unions, and communists increases greatly.
    3. Lenin, by 'iron will and discipline' is referring to unmoved devotion to the cause of the establishment of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.
    4. He explains that party members should not get intimidated by the bourgeoise's might- and instead be determined to bring it down.
2. The masses must have seen from their own experience that the party's strategies and political tactics work properly; the people must bear witness to the party's ability to adapt and improvise.
3. The party's members must merge and freely interact with the masses wherever possible- including bourgeoise and reactionary forums like the institutions under the bourgeoise's control- the parliament and media.
    1. The party members must agitate for socialism in these meetings and gatherings.
    2. They must also bring popular support to the downfall of these bourgeoise institutions, and expose their authoritarian control over people.
    3. The party should educate people on their rights.
    4. It must operate both local circles and mass-movements.
4. The party members must have a firm foundation in and a flawless understanding of Marxist Theory.
    1. They must apply this theory to their situation- using Dialectical and Historical Materialism to analyse the present contradictions, conflict, unity, and methods to resolve these contradictions.
    2. They must thoroughly study the history of their present situation.
    3. The party's member's should be thoroughly class-conscious and should work to educate the proletarian masses on the same.
5. The party's operations must be flexible.
    1. It should have the capacity to make and break promises and contracts, to rethink decisions.
    2. It should have the freedom and capability to operate in whichever method may suit it at the time- so long as it does not deter from the goal of establishing the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, underground or open, parliamentary or rebellious, legal and illegal.
